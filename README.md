# National Parks and Weather
Our group is examining the number of visitors to 5 popular National Parks in North America per month, and its relationship to the amount of precipitation per month that each park experienced.

We will also examine the relationship between the number of park visitors and the number of days with no precipitation in each park.

We will employ the OpenWeather API for weather data, and CSV files provided by the national park service that summarize the number of visitors per month.

We will need to join and aggregate the data concerning the number of park visitors and precipitation into a table in SQL, and then clean up our data by number of days with precipitation vs. without using our Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library to format our final DataFrame.

Weâ€™ll be using a relational production database (SQL), since our data relies on numerical figures, not text.

Our final project will provide a database containing visitor and precipitation information about all 5 national parks.  Within each you will find a table for each of the five national parks providing data for that specific park.
